polyglot will load and search standard dictionary formats for language learners

Language learners in position of foreign language dictionaries can load the files into polyglot, search and save words, write notes, and export saved notes to the format used by Anki.

## Details

Many dictionary apps exist, but very few of them have modern UI, the ability to load multiple dictionaries, or the ability to export saved definitions to list that Anki can generate flashcards from. The expection is this app will be natively developed for iOS and Android.
